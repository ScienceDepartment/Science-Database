**SCP 409, also known as “Contagious Crystal”** is a Keter anomaly contained in the MCZ. SCP 409 has a white crystal-like appearance with what seems to be white dirt surrounding itself. The crystal has two secondary crystals that split off. These secondary crystals have just as much ability as the main crystal. A pickaxe from either people that found SCP 409 or the transport sub-contractors is left swung into the dirt.

409 has multiple side effects on the afflicted if they were to touch the SCP's crystal. Several side effects have been documented, including loss of life, sore muscles, decreased running speed, resistance to a variety of sulfur-based explosives, such as bullets and grenades, and finally resistance to blunt force trauma.

SCP 409 has three known ways so far to infect a host,

* Skin-to-crystal contact;
* Host to Host contact;
* Deceased Host to Host Contact.

All researchers are mandated to wear hazmat before being allowed to enter the floor on which SCP 409 is held, this is to prevent a breach from occurring.
{% endhint %}

If a breach were to occur, all individuals inside a Hazmat suit would be safe from infection. In case of a breach, deplete oxygen in SCP 409's floor and any other afflicted zones on-site. In case of infection, terminate.
