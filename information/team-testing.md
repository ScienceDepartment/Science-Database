# TEAM TESTING

### What is Team Testing

Team Testing is the same as a normal test however rather than the test being hosted by one singular individual. The test will be hosted by a collaborative effort of 2-4 researchers working together. However there are certain expectations and rules that must be met and followed.

### How does it work

Team Testing is similar to a standard test, the only difference is that you work together with a group of up to 4 people to do a test report. You will work together to come up with question and report for grading. When you do a Team Test, you are required to write a report for grading. Once you have submitted your report, it will be graded and each member of the test will be rewarded with points.

### Rules and expectations

* Test must be performed on a Public Server.
* Everyone must follow guidelines and CoE.
* Must log one singular report for the entire group.
* The test must be within host limitations (The member with the lowest rank).&#x20;
