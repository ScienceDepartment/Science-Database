**SCP-662 also known as "Mr. Deeds"**, is a standard silver bell with intricate engravings. As it is made of very pure silver, it requires regular polishing to remain without tarnish. When rang a male figure by the name Mr. Deeds will appear through a door and fulfill the bell's "owner's" request(s).
