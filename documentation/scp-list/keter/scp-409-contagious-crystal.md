**SCP 409, also known as “Contagious Crystal”** is a non sentient Keter anomaly contained at MCZ. If one happens to touch the crystal, their body will start to “grow” a layer of that same white and translucent crystal.&#x20;

The full transformation takes some time to be fully complete, thus visual identification in its early stages can be achieved. Although not possible to observe from an outside perspective, infected hosts will have a slightly blue colored blurry vision.

Hosts will start to slowly lose HP and movement speed, which should be lower than the average walking speed of a healthy human, getting slower and slower the longer they’ve been infected. However, the longer an individual has been infected, the more resistant they are to both firepower, including grenades, and impact, such as punches Individuals who are wearing hazmat suits have shown immunity to 409 and its effects, even from infected individuals.

There are 3 known ways that SCP-409 infects hosts:

* Direct contact with the “original” crystal itself;
* If an infected host touches another individual, infecting him in the process;
* An individual touches the dead corpse of a deceased host.

When an instance of SCP-409 becomes deceased, their body will remain for upwards of 1 minute, before disintegrating into fine particles. It is also worth noting that the bodies can be cleared up with conventional gun shots, make sure to stay away from the body as it launches particles through the air.
