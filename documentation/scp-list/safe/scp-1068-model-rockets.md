**SCP-1068 also known as "Model Rockets"**, is a grey rocket downsized to fit in the hand of a person with its size being roughly one meter.

SCP-1068 can send a pulse in the local vicinity that disrupts any electronic device regardless of origin. We were able to reverse engineer this EMP back to our own devices and have successfully made a hot-fix to prevent future unintentional destruction of Paragon's radios and flashlights.

As of now, 1068 has no known side effects on individuals and does not cause any sort of bodily harm or mental stress, with that being said we will have to wait and see if truly has no side effects.
